# the-tech-times

The Tech Times is a news app. It is built with React and Javascript, and it consumes the [Hacker News API]("https://hn.algolia.com/api/"). 

You can run this project locally, by cloning it to a directory of your choice, and then - in the root of the project - by running "npm install", followed by "npm run dev". 

Some of the functionality is a WIP so enjoy ;-)
